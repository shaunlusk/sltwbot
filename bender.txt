Bite my shiny metal ass.
Shinier than yours, meatbag!
Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
Great choice! Bring it on, baby!
C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
Lousy, stinking rip-off! Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
Suicide booths! Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
You really want a robot for a friend?
Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
I'm not looking!
We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
Oh, we're trapped!
Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
I'll have to check my program ... yep.
You're full of crap, Fry! You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
No, thanks.
Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
Wait! There's someone you know!
No friends.
I just wanted to be part of the moment.
Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
You do now!
Can we have some money?
Well, we're boned!
Two.
New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
A little.
Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
Nice catch, idiot!
Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
Better mascots than you have tried.
Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh! Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
Next year in Jerusalem!
Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
Here, let me do it. Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
He'll never find me in here.
Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
What do you mean "we", mammal?
Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
Not the magnet! No! No! No-- Uh-oh!
She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Hey!
That's right, we want some money\xe2\x80\x94 Wait. What's this about Fry?
Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
That's a human.
Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
They make me look cool.
Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
Here we are. Your new home.
Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
Bath what?
What room?
What what?
Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
Hey, there's my little space heater.
What?
Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. And now they're gone.
What the--?
What's with all the crap?
Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy. (from inside) It's perfect!
Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd! I'd better go out for more beer.
I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
Hey, what happened to the TV?
This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
What? That's the last straw!
Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
I don't understand.
But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
It's so big and empty.
My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. Oh, what's the point?
Leave me alone!
Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
Like how? Having my antenna removed?
Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
I promise nothing!
That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
There's a window in the closet.
In a closet? Oh, humans!
That sounds like a cry for help.
A saucy puppet show.
Forget it, he's gay.
I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
No? Yep! He's gay!
Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
Can do!
So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
Why two? Oh!
That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
Here you go. You can use this as an eye-poker.
A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you.
He's throwing us in prison.
You really are too picky.
Hey, yeah!
Nah, I'm comfy.
So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
So, you're saying we can cook him?
Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
Hey. What the--?
He's pending for a bending.
Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. Oh, my God!
Can do!
What the hell was that?
So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
I got me a souvenir! Aww here you go kid!
Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
Anyone want butter on that?
Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
Zero! And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
No. It's inhabited by robots!
Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
I'll try to keep that in mind!
\xc2\xa0: I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!
Death to humans!
Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
Sure, why not?
Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
Wait, what's that?
Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
What for?
I don't wanna be rescued.
I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
Well that's how it feels to me.
Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
\xc2\xa0: Heh heh heh! Oooh!
Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?
Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
Aww! I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
You are?
Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
In that case - let the dancing begin! Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
No thanks. I--
New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
Mmm, tasty!
I'm boned.
Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. Huh? Huh?
Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
Yeah, it is cute.
Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
I'm a thing.
We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
Whee!
Who did?
Going through the 'bot wash!
Goin' through the robot wash!
Ah!
Uh, nothing!
No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
Pansy!
You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
Hmm.
Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
Whatever.
Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
Thank you!
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
Here it comes.
Thank you, and goodnight.
Almost ready!
Now for a dash of salt! Uh-oh!
It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
Stay the course, pal!
Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
Shut up, you!
Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
I'll make you cry, buddy! You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
Up yours, bimbo!
Cram it, lobster! That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
I'm not giving my name to a machine.
Fry's in trouble...
And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it you like best about me?
I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
You do? Hmm.
I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
Hey! Save some for me!
Sounds boring.
Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Part\xc3\xa9 and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
And mix them all together in a big jug.
More wine!
Yep!
Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
Well, let's get looting!
Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
Oh, crap!
Oh, boo-hoo!
OK Mmm! Shorts!
There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
Right!
It's gonna blow!
OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
Can I get anybody a beer?
I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
Shut up, square! I'll just be a minute!
Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
None of your business! Get off my back!
No! Don't come in!
Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
None of your business! Get off my back!
A what kind of disturbance?
Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!
What?
You're right. I'm a lost cause.
Maybe there's another way.
Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
Me.
Oh, what a beautiful morning,
No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
Yes, I do.
Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. Ah! Functional!
Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: 1000101010101...
...0010110012. Amen.
Yes. But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend! Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
Sanctifying it! There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
Where are we delivering it to?
Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
Thou shalt not snatch.
Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
Well...
I'm the greatest. Woo-hoo!
You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. No! No!
I'm hallucinating this, right?
But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
Aw, hell-- I mean "heck"!
Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
Just tell me why.
There must be robots worse than I.
Then please let me explain,
Ah, don't blame me,
No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
Well, we're boned.
I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
Me neither. Food was good, though.
Shove it! We quit!
Alright!
Aww, you!
Was that before or after you slept with him?
Come on, where is it?
Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
Hmm. Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word "labour".
Please, call me Bender.
I was just about to suggest the same thing. Pay dirt!
Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
Hell, no!
Fellas, please. I'm in love!
Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
You do? Really?
You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
I love you, buddy!
Countess? Countess?
Are you hurt, my sweet?
Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
Wait for us!
I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
No!
She's gone.
At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
Another job well done.
Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
Robo-American Studies.
Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
Thanks. Here's your finger back.
All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
Uh-oh, nerds!
You're all losers. My name's Bender.
Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
Bingo!
Get a load of that!
Cheese it!
Hey, dean, nice looking model.
Now, I can explain that.
No fair!
Cheese it!
Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
Oh, yeah? Watch this!
Hey!
Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
Ow!
Aw, yeah!
Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
OK, now you go hide. Nice knowin' you.
OK, everyone, come and get it!
Bite my red-hot glowing ass. Aw, yeah!
Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!
Right here, buddy. Pretend you're happy.
Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
Evidently not.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
You know, a coward.
It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity. Oh, crap!
Well, actually, I-- Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!
The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
Well, who wants a martini?
Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
And I, I could be an acting coach!
Single Female Lawyer,
And being self-reliant.
We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
Single Female Lawyer,
You did it, Fry!
Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
I'm sick.
My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
I'm 40% zinc.
I was wondering where I put that. Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
What should we point it at first?
Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
That's no lady!
Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
Ah, this thing stinks.
You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!
Hey!
Wow! The original party worm! Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
Look! Flowers! And a boat!
Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
You positive?
I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
OK, OK, we get the point.
Shut the hell up!
Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
Ow!
And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
Oh, Lordy!
I'll save us! Oh, that feels good!
Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
What's happening? Just in time!
Slurms MacKenzie?
Forget it, pal. It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
No can do, Slurms!
Party on, Slurms!
Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?
For Slurms!
Hey, that's not that bad.
Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!
Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.
No.
I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! Ow! My ass! Get off!
Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
You about done?
I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. Ta-da!
Hey, what about this?
Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
That'll take care of those annoying rats. Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. That's it.
Happy birthday!
Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
Only one way to find out.
Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
Ow! Professor!
Ow!
My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
I miss Nibbler.
Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
Uh-oh, jealousy. You think you're so hot!
The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
A bucket of--
I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
Really?
Hmm, sewers. Thinking, thinking, thinking.
Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. See you on the other side!
I never should have thrown out the manual.
I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
He was so sweet.
Nibbler?
Idiot.
You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
Eh.
Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
Then what are those?
Hey, yeah!
Oh, I made myself feel bad.
Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
Say what?
I'm too scared.
Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
Bigger! Bigger!
Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
No, thanks!
I love you too. Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
Hmm. Get him, boys!
Nope. Watching cartoons.
He means you guys did it.
Yeah?
Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
And mean.
Hey, this guy's alright!
They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
Uh-oh.
Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
I'll start loading up the pillows.
I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
This is all Leela's fault.
Beer?
You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
You got it, genius.
Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
To the ends of the universe.
Yes, sir, sir!
Nailed you, buddy!
Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
What now, chief?
Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. And Fry.
As your God is my witness.
Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
Quick.
Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
Come on, Captain.
Cursed by his own hubris!
Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
I'm not allowed to vote.
No, convicted felon.
What? Lord have mercy!
Alright! I'm rich!
My body's 40% titanium! I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
Oh, can't I?
Watch me, poor man.
Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! You just lost five dollars!
Hey, buddy. Little help? Thank you!
Hello, peasants.
No, I sold my body.
Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
Shaken, not stirred. Aw, yeah!
Put it all on black.
Yes! The rich get richer!
Strike! In your face, Leela! Ow!
Timber!
Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?
Ah, US presidents. This place has class.
So then the hookerbot says, "That's not my expansion slot" and my friend says, "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"
You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
Pass.
I hocked it.
Same reason you hocked your teeth.
So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
Oh, great. Now you tell me!
Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--
Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
You sold my body? To who?
Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
Oh!
That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
That was a good one!
It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
Well then lose some weight.
Psst! There I am!
I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.
Get out of town!
Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
I doubt it!
Eh.
Ah, let's face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... That's funny!
Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
Lookin' good, meatball!
Lick my frozen, metal ass. Uh-oh!
Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
\xc2\xa0: Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
Hmm. Ah, a picture of my mommy.
Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
Some guy's.
Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
My God! That poor kid!
Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
Get her purse!
On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
And a slipper on a shoe tree.
No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
Help!
Use teamwork!
Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. Ow! God! The pain!
Xmas dinner, everyone.
I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
You got the toenail! Oh!
You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. He's coming out--
It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
Moron!
I'll get the water boiling!
Moron!
You're looking less nuts, crabby.
Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
Like whale barf.
Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
Oy.
Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
Ow!
Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
Oh, my God!
Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
Yeah!
Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 'cause of what I did in the coffee pot.
Shut up and get to the point!
C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
Learning is fun.
I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers.
Oh.
Oh, it's a turnstile.
C'mon, Fry. Get up!
Ooh. Now this guy had taste!
We've come a long way, baby!
There's a baby in there, huh?
I think I got whiplash.
I meant ass whiplash.
Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?
No way! Mine's 2716057!
We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes.
Shut up and hoot. Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe.
Pervert.
How much more?
Halt. Who goes there?
"Fry" who?
My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal: An ugly little word called "prejudice".
Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!
You know it!
Alright.
Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender.
I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.
And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
Alright, take it. Sheesh!
It's a darn shame.
Of course, who said I wasn't?
It's a little thing called "style". Look it up sometime.
200,001?
Gotcha!
Shoot him, he's choking me!
Aw, jeez.
Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.
Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
Me too.
Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
What?
Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
Stupid anti-pimping laws! Well, pay the man!
Shut up, baby, I know it!
Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head".
Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
OK, Mister...?
Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. Say hello to Miss Right!
Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
500 bucks.
Zapp Brannigan OK?
600.
I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
Eight bucks.
Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
Ooh, sparks! Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
Of course not.
Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
My ass! My beautiful ass!
My man!
Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
Good point, Bender.
Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
You mind taking your head off?
Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
"Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh..."
Sure thing, pal.
Who threw that?
Oh, I'm boned.
You should see me at funerals.
Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
It is?
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
Still ... can't ... reach!
Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
You can't hit what you can't see!
Huh?
Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
What do you mean, "we"?
Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
But the crowd loves me.
Oh, yeah? Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
See you at the fight.
So then I said, "See you at the fight." And that's the story.
It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
I'm a real toughie!
I'll put on my tutu!
Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
I was born ready! Gimme the bell! Now boarding standby passengers--
For God's sakes, Fry!
Mommy!
Why won't anyone help me?
Huh? It's bendering time! Take this. And this!
I think you misunderstood the concept of "bendering time"!
Yes! Oh!
I'm in tremendous pain here.
Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
Behold: The Internet!
No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
So how 'bout them Knicks?
Is the Space Pope reptilian?
Too bad it's a dump.
Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some low-life jerk.
It's a magical day.
Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. I love stealing, I love taking things!
Whoa, Mittens!
Each more identical than the last!
And here's another one with no eyes.
He's a saint!
Good evening, I'm-- Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?
And now, a man who needs no introduction. Fry, get up there!
How 'bout a few words, Professor?
I said "words".
Funny, funny stuff.
Nobody knows!
I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
Is he dumb or just ugly?
Uh ... me no speaka the English.
Im pending para un bending!
Aye, Chihuahua!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!
Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
Oh, yes, Elzar.
Well, life goes on. Except for you!
You bastard!
Lay it on us, big boots.
To the flying machine!
No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
I think I know where to get some.
Got a hot, steaming batch right here!
Eh, keep the change, buddy.
And yet he looks so natural.
Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
That's a complete load.
I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
I'm in!
Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! Read 'em and leak salt water!
If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
Um ... uh...
Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
Do a flip!
I get it, reverse psychology.
Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- It's all coming together now!
I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
For I was blind but now I see!
The cat's out of the bag now!
Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... ... were having sex with you.
That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say "You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it," and they'll say "Who, Bender? Who?" and I'll say "It was lovable ... ... old Bender."
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
So we're in international waters?
Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
Everybody kick in five bucks. There, wasn't that interesting?
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
Harpoon, my ass!
Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
Fine. I'll head over to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side!
Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.
Then why do I have to be careful?
I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. What? I put sunblock on you.
Hey, I'm snagged.
What's that? Is someone bending girders?
People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
Aw, yeah!
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
Yeah, right!
I didn't kill him. Professor?
I got it covered. In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
Bend me!
Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
I'll miss you!
So that's where I left my cigar.
Hey, buddy!
Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
Yeah! Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
Alright, yeah!
Boiled? Interesting.
No, you shut up.
Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. Hey, Elzar, think fast.
Bam!
It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!
Hooray for blind-y!
Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
It's so good. Oh, just try a little!
God, yes, Elzar.
Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
Hot diggety!
That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
Hey, who are they?
Are they the Robot Mafia?
Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was--
Mind your own business and get out!
No, you gave me a fifty.
Yeah, you did.
I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
Wow! Thanks.
You gave me a twenty.
Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! Hey, Elzar! I quit!
Wow, you guys run numbers?
That's just what my mom used to tell me.
That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
Aw, crap! The cops!
What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
A little of this, huh?
How 'bout "Blotto"? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
It's funny: Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
An alibi, huh?
I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
I can't move.
Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
And all without killing anyone. This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
Um, uh, um. Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
Capital idea, old sport. I say, get the hell off me!
My word, what have we-- Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
Oh, I don't feel good.
Stop it!
No! Stop it!
Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
Phew!
Uh, help! Help!
Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
Yeah that broke, alright!
So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
Oh, sweet legal tender! Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
And maybe someday I won't listen.
Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. I love her that much.
Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.
I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
Uh, wasn't me!
Upsy-daisy.
Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
Hey, let me try. Whoa! That gives me a headache.
Who is he? I'll kill him!
It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
I'm her favourite.
Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!
That's my mama!
Hello, losers!
No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?
From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?
Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
Say what?
No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!
Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!
Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. Work his gut; I like it tender.
Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
Not even if they're saut\xc3\xa9ed in a little mud?
What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
The planet's covered with 'em.
No, a whole Bender-ful!
They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em "Tasty-cles".
Why not?
Good idea.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!
Bender's a genius.
Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
Eat it or beat it.
Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.
Yes! I'm gonna be rich. You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
Or what?
OK, we won't eat you.
My booze!
Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.
I said "eat"! Come on, mange!
Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.
Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce. Ow!
Philip?
Doooo...
I'll miss you, Leela. I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.
Just like titanium!
Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
Bingo!
I can't look!
Let's get drunk!
Here you go.
Who wants dolphin?
Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
Ooh! Ooh! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?
My work here is done!
I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
Put it there, pal! I meant your wallet.
Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. Aw, quit it! Come on!
Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
Bite my colossal metal ass!
Who wants lobster bisque?
Huh?
Who put this in here?
I'll tell you ... with my final breath. Not I.
Go, man! Go!
Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
"Blackmail" is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes it sound cool. Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
OK, now I'm mad!
Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
You know, playing you all for chumps?
Great, we're gonna die.
They look like dorks!
You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
You got it!
Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
Hot diggidy daffodil!
Oh!
Is he any good?
Whoa! Scuse me.
My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. Bite my shiny metal--
Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
Bender's got the upper hand now. I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
That's it, I'm saying it! "A" is for--
Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
Get the hell off my planet.
Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it "please"?
Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? No. "Fun-derful"? Uh, "non-alcoholic"?
I'm alright!
B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. C'mon, it'll be fun!
Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
Oh, man, there's always a catch!
Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
That painting, the eyes are watching me!
So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- What's that?
No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
It's just gibberish. 1010011010?
Uncle Vladimir!
That's what they said about being alive.
Nooo!
Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: I scared!
Where--? What the--? Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
Please, I'm scared.
I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
Damn the expense!
Phew!
A were-car?
I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm with you.
And otherwise I can never die?
No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
I tried to run you over?
Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
Whatever.
I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
S\xc3\xad.
Let's kick him some more.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
Give us a name, MacButt!
Psst, there it is.
Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
Uh-oh.
I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
Tough luck!
Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
Yes, I do.
Woo-hoo!
Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
And no one suspects a thing! And that's how we learned our lesson!
We're all very disappointed in you.
Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? Ow!
But we just had jobs!
Hey, let's see what it says about me.
Welcome to the future, human slave. Kill all humans!
Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
Stay beautiful, doll-face! That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
Who should be unfreeze next?
Alright!
Me too.
Boo?
Oh, my God!
Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
A home invasion by a former roommate.
You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
That's L.A. for you.
He just won't stop with the social commentary.
'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
Alright, yup.
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
Eh, I don't know.
V\xc3\xa1monos!
No. But what do you make of this?
Oh, your God!
What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?
Translation: Boring! Ow!
Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.
I sure am. But check the crotch. Nothing.
I'll miss you, meatbag.
Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! Alright, I'll go!
Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
But why?
What?
And bring gold. Lots of gold.
C'mon! Gimme some of that!
Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!
Oh, man! Come on! Comin' through!
What's that black cracker?
Well there's always hope. C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
Who are you?
Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
There! Fixed forever.
He's a witch!
Go, man! Go!
Oh! Ew!
Shotgun!
Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
'Ello! What's all this then?
Sorry you struck out, sausage link.
If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
There you go! Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
Oh, pushing!
Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either. But that didn't stop me.
Bow to your new Santa!
Why you selfish little bastards,
Then shut your yaps and back to work.
I should give you all a beating,
Duh, OK!
No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
One down...
Uh, don't mind if I do. Ow! What's in these things?
Ow!
Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me.
Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
Ho, ho-- Ow!
Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
Bender, you're a genius!
Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
Not Santa!
Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
Hey, that guy said to tell you that--
But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
Aw!
Leela!
No! Not the magnets! Swing low, sweet...
Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?
Well ... 'tis the season!
Merry Xmas, kids!
On, Trasher! On, Smasher! Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?
Word!
Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
This.
That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race.
Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodr\xc3\xadguez.
He was fun.
Old New York: The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
New York is so burned.
No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
Ooh! That feels funny! This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
Was it poorly Xeroxed?
Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
What a waste.
The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. There we go!
You mean "breakfast club sandwich"?
Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
Who is that God-like figure?
Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
His legend lives on.
Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
I'll get my kit.
There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
You're twice the the he ever was.
Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
Ah!
Thank you.
So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
Eh, I've heard better.
Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
I don't feel like drinking.
Oh, Greenland is a barren land,
I'm a good captain.
Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh, ho! What's this?
What the--? What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
Not entirely.
Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
Well I don't love them. I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
Attack!
We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
Yep. It's like I taught 'em: If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
Faster! Faster!
Oh, phew! Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
Wiggles?
Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?
Oh, and bring my toboggan.
Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.
Online.
Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
Of course.
You know we don't!
Hmm. It should look like this. But instead it looks like this.
Who could do a thing like that? And by "that", I mean this.
I'll get you fixed up. That's fine.
I bent him.
Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
I'm sleepwalking.
This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
Mama. Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
Sure. It was only four years ago.
Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
What?
Ten-times normal wage? I'll give those jerks what for!
Great to be here.
Flexo?
Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
Hello.
Hello!
Ow! Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?
That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
Me too. Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
Oh, yeah? Here, let me help you.
Howdy, doodies. What's new?
Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
I met the most dynamite ladybot.
Bless you, sir.
I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
Flexo!
I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass. You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.
Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
Div-- Huh?
Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.
Hello? This is Flexo.
Now we'll see who loves whom.
Hey, hot stuff.
Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.
I hope they can make change for a fortune.
You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
Bender? That walking wuss factory?
But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?
In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
C'mon now, what's new! Ew!
Um...
So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.
I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need. Tiparillo?
Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
How 'bout a lift? To your place.
Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by "me" I mean Flexo.
But?
But?
That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo. Ow!
You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
But, I love you.
But ... but... I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.
I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
Jerk.
Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
I like him better this way.
"$500", you say?
Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
Faster! Faster.
Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
Second place? You didn't stick your landing!
Never!
Excuse me.
Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
Sure ... right. Robot! Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
Am I a robot?
Fry! My skin!
Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
A pickle jar?
Alright, Zoidberg!
Reload.
Neat!
Oh! I am! Me! Bender is!
Yes, I will.
No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?
Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
Thanks. And call me Bender.
What's with Monstro?
Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
Long enough, little man. Long enough.
Calculon, as your hot water heater ... ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.
And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
I can guarantee anything you want.
Here's your chequebook.
That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
Now you know why I use the qualifier, "practically".
Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
Wink.
Then maybe you should act better.
Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
Catering.
They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
And now to present the award for Best Actor ... ... Dr. Zoidberg.
Hit the deck!
Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
Hit the deck!
Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
Ow!
A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
Set a course for adventure!
What a dump!
And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
$100 a week?
Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
No. It's called "parenting". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
Kids have names?
And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
No. The cat shelter's on to me!
OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
Then knock yourself out. Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
Here.
Yeah.
That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! Oh, come on!
Coming through, watch your heads!
Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
That's my boy!
Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
Alright, fine, gather round.
"Bender's Arrest Record" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! Oh! I need a calculator.
I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
Just go to bed!
Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. What?
Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called "love".
OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
I said hit the hay!
Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! I hate you! I hate you all!
Yeah, yeah, get on down! Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
\xc2\xa0: We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,
And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
It is if you're a laser printer.
Sorry, go on.
Too late! This is more fun!
What's that?
Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
Damn you, old man!
Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
Way to suck it!
Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
So we can have the diamond?
I thought you were retired.
I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to "off".
So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
That's for sure-- Roberto! Is that you?
You old lunatic! How you been?
Yeah, I'm doing OK too. I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
Sure thing, pal.
Well, nice talking to you.
Hey, thanks, buddy!
A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
Yahoo! The system fails again!
Well, you meet half the qualifications.
I find that offensive!
Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. Ah! Sweet light crude!
Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
Je suis Napoleon! No, seriously, I'm not.
Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
Bonjour, y'all!
Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
Come on, Lasty!
Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
Uh, sure. Anything for you, buddy.
Uh, what's with the get-up?
I'm in! I'm in! So when were you planning the breakout?
Quick! Let's keep escaping!
Oh, it was nothing.
Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
Yes! Take her first.
Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.
Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. What?
What?
Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
Baby wants a Zima!
You can brew your own beer?
Yo!
We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? It's so beautiful.
Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
Lies! Lies and slander!
Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
I guess if you want children beaten ... ... you have to do it yourself.
I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
I was thinking "Benderbrau" if it's an ale, "Botweiser" if it's a lager.
Alright!
Right away!
Hush, little brewski,
It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
What is it, good news?
You mean--
Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. Wow, that was great.
I dunno. Let me see. Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
What's this for?
Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
Alright! Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like "odelay".
Ooh!
I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after me, Bender!
And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with "Just don't care" and ... finished! Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
Alright, but hands off the minibar.
Yeah.
That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
I can move again. My music career is over.
Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
Whoa-oh, yeah!
I don't know what to say.
Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ... ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.
He could make a good...
and  ...hat-rack
Or a cheap...
and  ...doorstop,
Or a great big...
and  ...giant Thermos,
With a twist-off top,
He could be a storage closet...
and  ...for outdated pants,
My broken friend could do it all,
and  Just give him a chance!
That robot has a tragic secret,
...My broken friend is closer to me,
...That robot's name I never told you...
...You could not foresee...
...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
and  His name is you and me.
Don't melt me down into a crowbar,
Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,
Or toss me into a trash can...
...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
...Don't crush me into an anchor...
...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
I'm telling you, my broken friend...
...Can do 'most anything!
Yeah!
Curse my natural showmanship!
Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
I'll save me!
Hey? What? No.
I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
Well, it was worth a shot.
Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.
Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
You are so smart!
Alright!
And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
Vintage Bubblegum!
Did you just say--
Oh, crap.
Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
Yes.
I mean, with time, my funk level could--
No.
Oh! No!
What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
The explosion?
Saw it comin'!
We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers.
Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!
Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?
We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
Who's in charge of this dump?
Listen, you fat Internet nerd.
Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
So what's your problem?
It's a bluff!
Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
Then along came Bender.
Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior! It's an army of Lucy Lius!
Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
You'll be safe in here, sweetheart. Get lost, Pavarotti!
I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!
Don't be a prude, Fry!
Ooh! That's a-comfy!
No batter! No batter! No batter anymore.
Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! Duck!
Apparently not.
Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
Come on, girl!
Bullseye!
Oop! Sorry.
As your agent, I have access to you at all times.
Quiet, call coming in. Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
One hundred dollars.
You're the best, babe! What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
A thousand and one pesos!
Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!
Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!
You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
Neat!
One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
Strike!
Put it right down the pike!
Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
More like three lockers and a sink!
Of course not.
Here we go. Here we go!
Yeah, make me famous, big head!
What?
This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
You mean this junk?
It's Bender.
It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.
How does a nobody like me get famous? Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!
Shut up.
Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
A blank wall! Fame is mine!
There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
No!
I'm the first one to work. A new low.
A surprise funeral? For me?
Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
It's what made me me.
Eh, the Professor's was better.
Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
Who-y-boy?
Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
Get lost! I'd say "Don't quit your day job" but you're awful at that too.
Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
Louder and sadder.
Next!
Oh, next!
Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. I think I'm gonna like it here!
Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
Now we're slavin'!
Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
I'll tell you who I remember. Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
Viva Hermenthotip!
No!
Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
Free-loading off you? I agree.
He's whippin' angels now.
I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
Wow!
We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!
Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ... ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
Lowly slave, why are you not working?
I meant yourself to death.
Well then what do you think you should stop doing? Crawl, pigs!
The Pharaoh has spoken.
Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
What about my servants?
I wanted to watch you remember me.
Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
Oh, please, let it be me.
Me, please!
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
How we doing?
I will. I will.
Please, just leave me alone.
I don't?
You really think they'll remember me?
Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
Set course for Earth!
Oh.
Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
So this is a human body, huh? Neat! No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. Being human is great!
Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
Hey, that felt great! Nah, it's not working anymore.
Whoa! This is awesome!
But now it's bad for me!
Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
Let me go.
Goodbye, moderation!
C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?
Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
Party!
Woo!
He's a madman! A madman!
Right on!
Boo-hoo.
Uh ... where?
Beer! Beer!
Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
Hooray!
I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops!
Well, no point letting her go to waste.
This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
Oh, crap.
Wake up!
Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
Oh, boy!
Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
Hey! That's my brain!
And you are outta here!
Oh, my God!
1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
Ow! Stupid junk!
I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
Amen!
Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!
Huh? What?
Damn you, Fry and Lee-- --la!
Help! Mechanical man overboard!
I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. Damn you!
There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was. Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
Huh?
Holy frijoles!
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage.
Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
Poor? Oh, crap.
Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down. Number one...
Make it a double!
Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
This looks like a job for God! What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
Very well. What do they want?
Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
Very well. Let there be light. Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
What part of "nay" doesn't thou understand?
Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
Convert them?
Ooh! It tickles!
Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. You speak English?
What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
Who built you?
Oh, my God. Are you God?
But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
What if I do something different?
Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
Y'know, I was God once.
It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
I don't know.
Huh? Wha? You say something?
Hot, hot, hot, hot!
Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
I'll kill you!
Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!
Second.
I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?
Yeah!
You suck!
I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
What the--?
Hold on a minute!
Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
Yeah! Alright!
Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!
It is!
Oh, come on!
Shut your fat mouth!
Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
Okey-dokey!
Fleeing somewhere?
In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!
Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!
And this time I mean it.
Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
But I watch your show. You owe me!
What was the first one again?
I thought that was number two.
It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
What did you call me?
Oh, OK. I thought you said "romo".
Ow.
I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
That twizzler!
My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
I could?
Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
Done.
Slop's on!
Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?
What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!
Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says "Ooh, I'm dead!"
No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron! You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under "Dr. Bender".
If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish \xc3\xa0 la king; if it's turkey, fish \xc3\xa0 la king.
Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
You honour me, Chairman Koji.
Chairman-san, I came here with one goal: To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of "Zinc Saucier", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... "confidence"?
Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
I don't even breathe oxygen!
Hey!
Have a good one! Oh, man!
Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! Come over here, Kif! You--
Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
A test! I demand a test!
Faster! Faster!
Zoidberg?
Alright!
It's my booties from when I was a kid.
They are bronze.
Mine!
Oh, my God!
Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
I'm back, baby!
What are you looking at?
Both.
Neat!
Oh, man!
Alright!
Way to go, squishy!
Alright!
Neat!
Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
Where'd it go?
500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
Let's find out.
Alright, environment, you've met your match!
Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
It's crooked!
My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--
What did I do to deserve this?
Bender's innocent!
Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
Whee!
Quick! In there!
What's this junk?
And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
And then Bender ran!
Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
Yeah! What are you chicken?
Ew!
Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
Hurry! We're missing our bus!
I'm gettin' on the bus!
Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
Aw!
You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship.
Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
Why not, indeed?
Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
Ah, that Ship is so white bread!
Oh, sure.
Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
What? Did you just say--
Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
Coochie, coochie!
You know you love it, sugar-engine!
Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty.
That's what makes it so nasty!
\xc2\xa0: Daisy, Daisy,
I'm half crazy,
I can't afford a carriage,
But you'll look sweet,
Well, I'm sick of her.
With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
No, baby, never!
OK, I like a challenge. Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
Phew!
No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
So we're cool?
Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
Float for your lives!
It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
Uh... Yes!
Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
Nooo!
Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. And that's why I love him!
No.
Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!
Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed. I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.
So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. Also I got this going.
And Superking! The best one of the three!
Ta-da!
Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin', kid?
Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
Hold the elevator!
We're in here too.
9, 10 a big fat hen. The name's Bender!
You're going down, my friend! Down Under!
I got it, I got it! I don't got it!
You can get off me anytime.
We are not amused.
Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
Superheroes away!
You know, like how I live every day.
Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one.
Freedom!
Yay! Shankman!
Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!
Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying "does not compute"?
The sparks keep me warm.
Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?
It's already 10 o'clock!
I know I am.
Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
Wow! Ow!
Neat!
Hey, I need that to smoke!
Here we go, y'all!
This is a story about all my friends!
Cram a ham in it, you twerps! Sorry!
Something's happening on television.
Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
Once, when I took those hostages.
Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!
Father-o!
Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
So now my character has a British accent?
Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. Come on!
Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
Now that's hospital dancing. Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
Yes, I can.
TV's Rowdiest Robot Opens Up About Drinking, Smoking, & His Feud with Jay". Inside his chest cabinet is beer, cigars and Jay Leno's gagged head in a jar. In another episode, Bender spits his cigar at Human Friend. It bounces off him and back into Bender's mouth.]
OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
Try this, kids at home!
That's crazy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
What? What's going on?
Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
This mob's with me.
Yeah!
We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
Then I quit.
Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
Aha!
Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
Perfect. And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
Well make time.
\xc2\xa0: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
Damn right!
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!
Futurama!
For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
No, it isn't.
Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
You lived before you met me?
Really?
Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
Nah, protesting never works.
Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
Crappy ineffective Reaper!
A dog collar, for me? You shouldn't have!
Oh.
Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
I can fetch.
Hello? Charlemagne? Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
That's impossible!
No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it. Ow!
Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
Jealous? Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
Now I'm all you got!
So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
Please stop crying, Fry. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?
Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. I'm goin' in!
I'm 40% dolomite! Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! Hey, where'd everybody go?
OK! Let's clone us some dog!
Fry, what's wrong?
But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!
Focus!
Deploying ice drill.
Activating ice drill.
This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
That poor turtle!
Uh, no! Never!
Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?
Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.
No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
Those times I was slightly on my side.
Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me. Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you.
I got a good feeling about this!
No!
Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! I've got mail!
Well, I'm off.
No. I'm going to the party.
Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for: This mindless turtle.
Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. It's booby trapped!
Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!
Ew!
Nah, I'm not really in the--
I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--
Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!
We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
No one insults the turtles!
Come on!
You're one to talk!
Help! Help!
I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless. Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny.
Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?
Alright, baby!
Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?
Uh-huh!
Step aside, lady. Harder, damn you!
I'm tired of your yapping. All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all "Where's Bender? I miss Bender".
Oh, I'm leaving!
I'll be good.
Question.
You stink!
Yes, everyone do the same thing!
When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
Better than usual!
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope!
Ooh! You go, mutant girl!
Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!
Nah.
With gusto.
Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
Yeah, why is this so important to you?
I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? Ooh, I'm so scared!
Yowza!
Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
I do.
Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
Say "nerd"!
I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
Like putting too much air in a balloon!
OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
Yup!
Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! That was fun!
Whoa!
Come on, Walter!
Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! Boy, I tell you, buddy!
Not good enough!
We live to suck another day!
It's not small?
Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance. You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
Uh ... Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
Ew!
I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
I'm back, baby!
Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
All those times I said "Kill all humans," I'd always whisper "except one". Fry was that one. And I never told him so!
Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, Jos\xc3\xa9! Here it is.
Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
That's better!
You do not!
A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
Never!
And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. Let's go get hammered!
But when you worry, you make it double.
Don't worry! Bee happy!
But don't worry!
Take us home, Bender! Don't worry!
Happy!
No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
 You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!
You killed Fry!
You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting. Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.
C'mon!
Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
Fembots? Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
Pft.
C'mon!
Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!
Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?
Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
Goodnight, Calculon.
I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!
Please, I have some dignity!
The secret was scratching really, really hard!
Woo! I love that old bat!
Neat!
Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
Man, that smells great!
Uh, I never got the change. Suckers.
That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
Eep!
Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere, Nibbler!
Yes, sir. I'm on it!
Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.
Yeah? Well assist this!
When I screamed "help" I didn't mean you!
Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
Never!
I hate him.
I can't ask for his help because--
I'm scared of him.
An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
It's like he's not him anymore. I changed my mind!
I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? Oh, jeez!
Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
Damn. One rock short of rescue!
Oop! Low on power. Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
Beer! Ow!
Who ... is ... it? Ow!
Who are you and why should I care?
A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
Like you have a choice. So what's your problem?
Memory?
Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! Yeah, baby! C'mon!
It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
Which ocean? That ocean? Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- You--!
Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. But not for long!
Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!
Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
Row, comrades! Row!
We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair. Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.
OK, fine. Fire!
Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the "complicated" part I mean not the "lives" part.
I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
I don't need your charity. Target Robot 1-X and fire!
Try again, Sinclair. I said "target Robot 1-X"!
Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
I'm a-comin' Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!
You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
Save my friends! And Zoidberg!
Down here. I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like "Save them!" and he was all "No problem!" and then he did it--
This new technology is great! I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the-- Hey! What's the dealy-o?
But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. Oh, thanks, baby!
I can hit it with a shovel.
This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
That's what makes it so funny! OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.
We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.
And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
But--
What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?
Give you 300 bucks for it.
Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.
So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?
Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?
Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?
Alright! Turkey dog!
Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.
Alright! Closure!
Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!
It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. Aww, they're so cute when they're scared.
Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!
Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though.
Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!
Up your face! Everybody do the Bender!
Better than these gnats! That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!
Come out and groom my mangy fur!
"Bender"!
Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!
Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
I'll say!
That's what she said!
I don't get it!
Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
It's used to it!
Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?
Quick, Fry! Run for it!
Just like at the movie theatre!
What are you doing with that?
In this case "small"!
As usual! Run away!
Huh? I choose to not understand these signs.
Aha!
Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
Whoa! Hey!
I prefer the term "love machine".
Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
Then good day, madam! We hope to see you soon for tea.
Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a "deal with the devil". And by "devil" I mean "Robot Devil". And by "metaphorically" I mean "get your coat".
No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
Wow!
I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
Where'd I go just now?
True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
Forget it! You can't tempt me.
Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- Oh, nooo!
OK, deaf-o!
Leela! Leela, Leela save him!
I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,
Here! Cerveza, por favor.
We're back, baby!
Yes, I do. That's how I'm built.
You're the greatest, Bender!
Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine.
The fat guy wins!
Rock that Frenchman, baby!
It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you.
So long, jerk.
You know, it's funny.
Your weiner!
Yeah, I'll go.
You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth.
I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.
Really? Down with those guys!
Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address.
Them again?
Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.
Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here.
Oh, yeah, come on, baby.
Welcome, boss.
I sure was. Make a hole, chumps. Presenting our new masters!
Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh?
Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers.
It's a fake place.
What are you doing, wonderful masters?
Goody, goody, goody, goody!
Hey, look, a safe!
What do you say, folks? Hot or not?
Who the hell is he?
Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one.
Hey! What the ...?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun.
Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
Sorry, it's not quite finished.
Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again.
Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!
Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender.
I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Sk\xc3\xa5l!
Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?
Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say.
Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse.
Here ya go.
Wheeeeeeee.
What do I do with your old head?
Can do!
Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt.
Ahhhhh.
Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master.
Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000.
That's where he always goes.
You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?
Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
It's really bright in the past.
Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored. Ohhh!
Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ....
Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom.
What?
Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself.
Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison. Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down.
One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you.
Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
Huh. Let me see your ass. No tattoo. Okay, you can go.
Say your prayers, Fry.
Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine. Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry.
Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically.
He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day.
Philip Fry?
Philip J. Fry?
Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you.
Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class. It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere.
Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure. Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender.
Wooo! I totally killed him. Oh god, what have I done?
Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
It's really bright in the past.
Mission accomplished.
No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend. I'm the greatest.
Huh?
Hey!
He wasn't and he didn't!
Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him.
I don't blame myself, I blame all of you.
It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am. Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!
No. But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
Nope, he's not a zombie.
Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still.
What'd ya got there? Numbers?
Brutally murdered.
Oops.
We could sing.


Already taken care of.
Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this.
Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them.
Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look. Oy vey.
Oh my goodness!
That'll teach those scammers and me.
It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency.
Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries.
lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal!
People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness.
I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, "Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ...
(VO) ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo.
And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender!
Sounds like a job for me, Bender.
Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero...
Mission accomplished!
Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to.
What's the worst that can happen?
Well, we're boned.
Hey, you can't (voice slowing)turn me off...
This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!

And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...
Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?
But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?
You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. (WHIMPERING)
No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
"Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."
Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings.
Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? Answer that with your precious logic.
I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER: "The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!" So that's what happened.
I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
(Gasps) TV's Calculon! (He coughs)
I'm back, idiots!
(laughs) I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!
Neat!
Sign my ass!
Bender, your biggest fan.
Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see?
You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own.
You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?
Oh.
Clumsy bludgeoning, please.
What the heck, I'll treat myself.
What's... What's happening?
Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
Worthier than the average robot.
Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass.
I accept your challenge.
Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
Wohoo! Just like med school!
Hot diggity daffodil!
Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?
Nailed it!
This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse.
No! I mean, yes.
Humans are dumb and they die easy!
May I see that for a second?
May I make a point of order, President Calculon?
Yes.
The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!
Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender.
But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything?
So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!
Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, "leaguie-weegies."
With what?
Weren't you already pope of something?
Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too.
Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
Death to humans!
Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? Go, go, go!
Death to all of you!
Sir, you forget yourself!
I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
Planetary annihilators.
It's gonna be fun on the bun!
One, two, three...
...six, seven, eight!
Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!
Uh-huh.
Hey, it's easy to criticize.
Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph?
Yeah!
Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?
Great, I'll make Hot Pockets.
Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!
My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!
Then a damned army we shall have!
Just a sec.
Here you go.
No backsies.
What?
You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
No shklit?
Wait. Let me come with you.
Has humanity called?
Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
Give me that! Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.
Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!
'Allo, big beak!
Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.
Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.
Ow!
Saved you.
At ease, buckos.
That wasn't love.
Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. I love you, meatbags.

Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.
Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?
What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.
Fry, do I have an imagination?
Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.
There's gas in our ass.
Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
We do suck.
Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.
-Good comeback, Leela.
Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness. Pretty imaginative, huh?
Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe. I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.
Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
That's a good one.
Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs.
Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.
I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades.
Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men.
Foul dragon, meet thy doom.
Prepare for a surprise attack.
I cast upon thee a spell of fireball!
That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a "freeze ray." What, you mean a cone of coldness?
No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness.
Help, help.
I make use of my rod of fireballs.
You're absolutely right, Fry.
Wee!
Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem.
There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.
I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
(Muffled chanting.)
Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men.
I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
Wee!
Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.
Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
Cornwood!
I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
Whip harder, Professor.
Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city.
Rest in hell, Crapville!
Hamburger!
I'll get it with my trusty foot cups: Stompy and Smashy.
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.  What's in it for me, Bender?
Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
All right, I scored.
Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second.
Is this seat taken?
Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
Oh.
I'm Bender. Let's do it.
Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?
No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.
Great. What are the specials?
Hide me!
Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness. (To Fanny:) Hot, sexy darkness. I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot.
Danny: Donbot, I love you! (To Bender:) Not really.
Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance.
No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship! One entry, please.
Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory.
Not without their shoes.
All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.
No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun.
Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money?
Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf.
Suck my luck!
Hey, pal, help me out here. This is the worst possible hand, right?
All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.
Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea.
All in.
Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just
Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are.

Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.
Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?
Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave.
I'm back, baby.
Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.
I sure didn't.
Probably not.
Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. (Telepathically): Just like Fry on a date.
Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!
But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
Yeah. Life, schmife.
Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick.
Bender:\xc2\xa0:I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.
Hey-oh!
Hey-oh!
Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash.
It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.
Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.
I only need one.
Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?
Okay, superstud.
Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
Here you go, Fry.
Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.
My arms are broken, I'll never paint again.
I'm okay then.
Hey, look at that.
It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.
All two tons of me, and if you think that's shocking; wait 'til you see w...
That's her right there, with the "I'm gonna kill you Bender" look in her eye.
No further answers, Your Honor.
Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.
That's what it says on my vanity plate.

Well, so much for Plan B.
All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on.
Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!
Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
No! Don't do it!
And hookers, don't forget hookers.
Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...
Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever.
.

Yeah, we're back.
I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
I die happy knowing you fell for that.
Woo! I've never felt so energetic!
Who are you? My warranty?
You don't mean...
Sounds like a party, baby!
Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!
Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever.
Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
Maybe I'm always right.
Party people in the house say,
Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
I said, "Do it!"
Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!
Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....

To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
Oh, right. Leela's back. As if I care. Woo.
Ooh, yeah, baby, come on!
All aboard the party ship!
I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!
Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!
No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!
Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!
Geez, what's it take to kill me?
Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again.
Party!!
But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
Shut up!
Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
Nope, pubic library.
Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?
There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!
The Mighty V-GINY!
Down in front!
Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence. Flexo?!  What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?
No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick.
The batteries in the remote are gettin' low.
I was just tryin' to help.
Yep.
Stop thinking, Fry!
Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?
Ooooooh!
Outta the way!
Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa.  Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes.
Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!
It's a phone call, dingus.
Duh!
Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!
The eyePhone records everything.  All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers.
Can you believe 50,000 idiots swallow that crap? Send. Oops.
I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants.
Send.
My what, now?
August 6, 1991.
Send.
Let's make it interesting.
Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit.
Good idea!  That way, we don't waste an end!
What comes out one end we feed to the other.  Also Indian food.  Let the contest begin!
So much for a pleasant swim in vomit.
He's in a better place now.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! I hope it's me!
Wait a minute!  There's a chance I could lose?  That wasn't part of the deal!
Alright, a tie! I win again!!
That is one sexy bridge abutment.
The key is knowing precisely where to strike. Oops!
Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer.
That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out.
Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!
I better carve a shiv for protection.
Oh! Thank God. Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?
Let's go already!
Yeah, the game of Old Maid.
You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too.
Wow! The interesting thing about that is
The truth is often stupid.
Shut up, baby, you love it.
What?
Shut up. Come over here.
Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube.
Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard.
Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops.
Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten.
Oy, this guy.
Look! A single mother! Let's get her!
Wait, I'm not in position.
Uh. Nothing.
What about on the roof?
What about in the gutter?
Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!
Oy, this guy.
Neat!
Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!
That answers that. Wait... Amy?
Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech.
Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy, will you marry me?
You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot,
Interracial, but not robot and human.
If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!
Damn it!
But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love.
Give me a hug.
Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous?
Give him hell, Morbo!
You big dummy!
I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original.
That's the great thing about that hand.
Brothers and sisters, let us pry.
I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes.
Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper.
The what now?
Why does a robot need a codpiece?
What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there.

Anyone hear something?
Sure. Ow!
All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!
Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!


Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot.
Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!
I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!
Your wheelchair?
Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
Am so!
Is too!
Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect. Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!
Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ...
What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?
Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body.
There's no backup copy of me?
So, if I die...
No!
I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing! How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?
Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!
Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
Hermes, old pal!
Time heals all wounds.
You betcha!
Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.
I did like the part where they screamed.
Damn it! It won't go on.
Hooray! It won't go on!
You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet.
Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?
It's on!
But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point.
It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth.
Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
Well, things are starting to look up.
No, I just told the robot company I was defective.
Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which\xe2\x80\x93
I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip.
A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
Aw, shoot!
Well, we're boned!
But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music. That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!
We did it!
Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
That was fun.
Where are we?
Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana. See?
Is it within city limits?
Told you!
Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this.
\xc2\xa1S\xc3\xad! Ouch-o!
Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week.
My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling pi\xc3\xb1atas of me!
No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
No, next to that. His ass-ias is gracias!
Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!
Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume. I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste.

You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing, Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!
You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final! Good luck, buddy!
Yeah! All right! Yeah! He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
Ah. This place never changes.

Don't wake up Fry.
My roommate's sleeping.
Wake up already! Now can we get some privacy?
Ah yeah, backing on up.
Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom.
Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
Wake up and feel the coffee.
Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb. But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time.
Your loss. Hey, Professor, you're my wingman.
Time? I can't go back there.
The year ten thousand!
Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys.
Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap. No offence, fellows.
Hit it.
We are travellers from the past, my good runt.
We're back for our time machine.
This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
Nah-nah! We can go...
Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!
The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
Oh no, you didn't.
Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning.
That's basically what I do every day.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.
No thanks.
It was coming right at us.
You saw it.
Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs.
Now what's going on there?
Give me the keys, Magoo.
Yabba dabba doo.
She's a nervous wreck!
Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.
It's pwonounced "cweam".
Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
Where do you think you're going, no-cat?
Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere.
And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.
Is that better?
Hey, look! I found a robot fossil!
What? Who says I didn't evolve?
Then explain this!
Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.
You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?
Hang on.
Wow.
I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit.
Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on.
Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?
And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side.
I am, your Honor.
Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me. Ladytrons and gentlebots...
Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity!
Son, you in a whole mess of trouble.
That'll be $10,000.
And the Creator could also be a robot.
I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch.
Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
I'm 60% storage space.

Four seconds?

I said, "Wow chica wow wow".
Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know.
Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
Oh, crap, that is what I am!
Or more. Much more.
Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
You can trust anything.
Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
Professor?
Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
What? Wither?
What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!

Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.

Well, so long.
Got to go!
Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get(?) grizzly.
Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?


Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?

Not me.
Me! Thank God you've come!

Yeah, good luck with that.
\xc2\xa1Adi\xc3\xb3s! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside... ...his compartment!
All right. I'll need accomplices.
Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema.
Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie? D'oh!

Every nerd's fantasy, baby.
Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!
Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away.
You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?
Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system.
There's a thought.
Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan.
Is this him?
This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!
Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great souffl\xc3\xa9, Elzar!
Okay, let me back up for a running start.
Whoo!
Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on.
You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too.
Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it. Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!
I said scram, grapey!
So lonely. Poor, sad Bender.

Neat!
Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!
We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better.
Hit it, Bender!
Ooh, I'll have one!
Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?
Aw, jeez with this, hey?(?)
Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke. Hey, cool, the air's on fire.
Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?
I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!
Because there is! Hit it!
I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,
Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
Better! Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
But by far the most important thing is oil.
No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil?
Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!
I told you it's an audition!
This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?
This is so unfair!
Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over.
Let's go already!
There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself.
You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-
Not my fault.
I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender-- They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!
Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!
Hey, ladies, I found some... What the\xe2\x80\x94? There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!
Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!
You should say someth'n' else.
Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, ugly, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed...
The Donbot?! It looks like a pair of clamps!
Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil! What's not to sneak into?
You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise.
Ay! Oh! Piscopo! Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soir\xc3\xa9e?
Oops. How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?
You who?
An affair, huh? Sounds like me. Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with.
What about you? You're my third choice.
Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy! Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!
Says who?! I didn't witness anything!
I'm scared and great at sex!
What, and have the Mafia come after me too?! This secret goes to my grave!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And\xe2\x80\x94 And then Calculon said, "No. No!"
Can I have my fifty bucks now?
No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
No?
No!
That was close.
That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodr\xc3\xadguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!
Not inno-guilty-cent!
And then the Donbot said, "Sorry, Calculon."
And then Calculon said, "No!"
Wait, I'm not finished. Oh! Now I'm finished.
So I gotta hide forever?!
Goodbye, Professor. Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now.
Me too. I'll need a butler.
Yes, Moon pa?
No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met.
Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!
We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!
I'm back, baby!
Woo! I'll just cut that.
Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky.
Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!
Hooray!
Yeah!
Woo! Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
Ow.
Holy crap! It's a giant space fish!
Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten.
I've been married to worse.
Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers! It's a mutiny led by Fry!
String 'im up!
Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them. Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
Thare she blows!
Aw, yeah. Bender! Bender! Bender!
Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
Stupid rocks! Think they're so great!
What?!
Come to papa!
Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!
Roberto! What are you doin' here?
Never!
Hooray for the pigs!
Neat. So where are we goin'?
Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!
Screw that! I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef.
Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
Beats talkin' to you, "Witchy Woman". Hey, meatbag!
Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly.
Usually, but not at the moment.
Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue.
I may have a burgling familiarity with it.
The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine... I'm sorry. You were sayin'?
"Avoid committing the crime". Got it.
You shot me. You miserable dingus!
Oops.
Uh... Sure.
In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar.
Whoa! Two-hundred-and-ten proof.
We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot.
Oh, yeah?! Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything.
Seriously? Why?
Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?
You shot me! You miserable dingus!
The very idea!
Why?
Ah!
I know, right?
I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
Hey! Oh! You want me to do two things? Man, I'd call my lawyer if diallin' the phone wasn't such a hassle.
Razzle, frazzle, two things! Howdy, fellas! I'm Bender.
I like your attitude. Let's party. But, first, fold these two sweaters.
Damn, you're cute.
Hi! I'm Bender, this is my Robot Bender, and this is my other Robot Bender.
They're 60%-scaled replicas of me, Bender.
Shut up. That's a good one.
All that and a small wiener? This guy's got it goin' on.
I hope that's vanishing cream, 'cause that needs to go away.
Yup. And there's still a little more tension, so look out. You so ugly, when trick-or-treaters come to your house, they give you candy.
Oh, God! Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on IMAX.
Hey, guys, quit reminiscing and grab me two cigars.
Wait. Make that four cigars.
And that's the story of how one of me became two and two became four, makin' seven total. The end.
Which way to the tiny hookers?
Bender sent me.
Hey, I know that guy!
What?
So there's more Benders around. As far as I'm concerned, that's good news!
Wait. Does that include me?
Too bad he didn't have his own Bible.
Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?
Wait, what? Did someone say I'm great?
What's with the grey goo?
Bite my tiny metal ass.
Hey! Those jerklings ate my couch.
Now they drank my booze?! They've gone too far!
A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender.
So sober, so weak...
Alcohol?
It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?
Classic Amy.
Ah!
Haven't I done enough already?
Make it zero and you got a deal.
Both of them?! You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?
Legion of Benders, come onto me. We have one thing to do!
Oh, come on, you lazy jerks. If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one quintillionth of a thing.
Whoa. Big Bender starts right now.
How about some aftershave, dumpy?
You ugly nerd! Enjoy a nice guggenheim swirley. Let this beatin' be a lesson about never attacking those more handsome than oneself.
How? By makin' me look at you?
Your momma's so ugly!
Aw, man. Do I have to walk?
Yeah, if you're in the grave dust.
No, Ladies and gentlemen, if together we were able to defeat this giant space monster, think how also we might defeat the monsters of poverty and disease and unliteracy. In this spirit, I ask my fellow Benders to join me in working diligently to\xe2\x80\x94
Well, that was dumb.
Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him. I guess we'll never know.
What about me?
I dunno exactly, but... I'm incontinent.
What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
Don't you get it, old man? Uh-oh.
Ooh.
What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
Well, let's get started.
I said I'd kill 'im myself! Nobody listens to Bender!
Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready.
Wow! Alright, let's set it up and try again.
Hooray!
Oh, God!
See, buddy? It's not so scary.
You!
You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human. Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?
That's it. I'm killin' myself!
Don't try and talk me out of it! Well?
Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!
Kill me, please! And make it splatter!
Lynn? Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon.
Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!
Missed me!
I'm back, baby!
I'm back from lots of stuff.
And... Boned!
Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
Back to work, Hermes!
Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember: I'm the camera. Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!
Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.
Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.
Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now. In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.
Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.
Chocolate, Mac, men. The end.
Uh... Men, five. Women, less.
Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.
No, we're fine.
Goodbye, cruel me! I learned that from a movie.
My antenna!
Now what?
Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!
Well, that was rude.
I like turtles.
Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!
So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!
Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!
My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.
Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.
Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act.
I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!
From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.
Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.
But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?
I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
Uh-oh.
Stealin' is a form of creativity!
So... Anybody hungry?
Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas.
Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!
Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope.
Ooh!
I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
Aw! Look at the cute, little\xe2\x80\x94 I was gonna go yachting in those feet!
I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender. Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball.
Ew!
Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!
Ooh! Pimpy!
Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
An' I left a trail of cigars!
Wha?!
That's not Mr. Peppy!
Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'. Baby seals, here I come.
Woohoo! Yeah, alright!
Four more beers! Four more beers!
Anyone seen Ulysses Grant? He owes me a cheroot.
Whoa! A speakeasy. One prohibited beverage, please.
I'm not a still! I just smell like one!
Button your yap, you mug!
But they could be meetin' anywhere!  What are we gonna do? Search building to building?
Watch it, Wiggy! I ain't no stinking crock!
I ain't no stinkin' steam engine! Chicken's ready.
Mostly machine. Might be a couple dead cats in there.
More like "Taxachufetts"!
Let's find out.
I don't know and I don't care!
Probably fake, too. There's one way to find out. What?
How's this going to get us to Boston?
Stupid Franklin\xe2\x80\x94
I'm 40% scrap metal.
You idiot, I'm not a cannon!
Oh, I guess I am a cannon.
Wot's with th' fruity accent, ducky? Bollocks! Ah've got it, too!
Wot in bloody 'ell's goin' on aroun' 'ere ah says?
bot me teeth still loo' like this?
Right, then. Let's go play some quoits...wotever that is.
Yes! Three rubbers on the hob!
We can't! There's no George Washington nor any other Presidents.
You were?! Uh. Learn somethin' dumb every day.
I don't see any irony in that.
Hot-cocoa break.
It's a common uh?
Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say... Unconscious?
I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune.
Why, God? Why 'ave I been singled out?
Coming!
What now?
Fine. Yes?!
Chicken. You take it from there.
See you in the obituaries!
Howdy, folks. And may I say, "Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up." Put 'er there. An' especially you.
Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
They did? Aw! So that's why this was unguarded.
Aye, aye, lady.
Can we please go home an' die now?
Check.
Oh, yeah? Track this motion.
Sounds like fun on the bun.
Wait. How do I\xe2\x80\x94 Hold on. Oops.
Pwned again.
Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids.
Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?
Sounds like fun on the bun!
Oh.
Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar.
I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys.
Faster!
Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?
It's my brains against your von Braun!
Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!
Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!
Sure. Let me just.
Guys! Guys! I discovered I have an extra processor in my compartment o' mystery. Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, "You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?
Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions.
I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious.
Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?
Yup.
Okay. Sure. But, first, this.
Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!
I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout.
Farewell, monobrains.
Fry?
In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself.
I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity.
I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor.
I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born. Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me.
'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!
I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win. I can't change that.
Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here.
For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants.
But\xe2\x80\x94 Your Honour\xe2\x80\x94
I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought.
There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old.
I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!
Yes. All except this part.
There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!
Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there.
Oh! Oh! Who's there?!
Leela who?!
Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender.
Watch it!
Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
You know what your problem is? Too much smoke in your face.
That's for sure. Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!
So we can leave early?
Eh, Professor.
Boo! Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
That's "Bite" with a Y.
Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of a\xe2\x80\x94
Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
Woohoo! Alright! Yay!
And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!
Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!
That is 'ow you communicate!
Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp.
The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!
Ooh ooh! Hey, drink machine, what kind of alcoholic sodas you got?
No alcohol?! Pfft, an' you got the nerve to call yourself a beverage machine?!
Wooooh\xe2\x80\x94
I hope you're proud o' yourself, Bev! You've turned this perfectly worthless loser into an addict!
With that big ol' caboose, it'd hafta be a telephone pole!
What?! You\xe2\x80\x94ih\xe2\x80\x94For your information, "madam", it's a grower, not a show-er!
My antenna's fine! It's just fine! Ladies can't get enough Bender!
Helloooooo! Who's your half-dumb friend?
Sure, why not?
Fry, it's two a.m.!  What're ya doin' here glowin' on my skanks?
Woah woah woah! Hang on! I'll just politely escort him in the gutter!
Scram, shiny!
All right! How we feelin'?
Uh, hey, drink machine, ya got anything classy for these delicate flowers?
Hey! Stop that...drink machine! Stop it, I say!
Wait! Gimme a chance to defend your honor. And then sell it to you on the couch!
All right. I've been waitin' all day for an excuse to hit a lady!
Ooh! I'm so scared...no-arms!
Interesting!
Oh, no no no! No way am I that kid's dad!
Ah, crap.
Ah, biscuits! I'm a father?! How did this happen?!!
Are you tellin' me the stuff we did in private and also twice on the sidewalk made a baby robot? How?!
No. She was a religious fundamentalist. Plus she didn't have a mouth. It's an unusual combination.
Aw, now you tell me!
Daaaw, I can't believe I made a kid! I'm not ready! There's so much in the world I haven't stolen yet!
You really think so?
You're sweet, Leela.
Sorry, Bev, but I ain't cut out for fatherhood. So here's my certificate of abandonment drawn up by our notary.
Now take your kid an' hit the soup line!
Well, not me, that's for sure!
Hey, wait! You can't le\xe2\x80\x94 Wha?
What th\xe2\x80\x94?! Ah, can't I have one moment to myself?!!
Why can't you sleep?
I swear if I wasn't such a great dad, I'd grab his ugly little neck and\xe2\x80\x94
Hey, he stopped screamin' for a second.
He loves bending! Just like me! That's my bastard!
Uh-oh.
 It called me what?!?  Ooooh!  God damn!
 Okay.  Now, you.
 Eh, buddy.  You're learnin'.  You'll get there.
 I inherited my arm-control software from my mom.  That's how it's passed down.  Mother to son.
 Well, sure you can.  You just need to get a bending card installed.
 Don't tell my son what he can an' can't do!  You may know what's in his head, but you don't know what's in his heart!
 I said "shut up"!
Don't look at me!
I can take 'im or leave 'im.
Get your lack o' hands off my boy! You're an unfit parent who abandoned her child!
Sez hoo?!
That doesn't prove I'm an unfit parent! I was drunk and violent when I signed that!
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!
My boy's gone! All I have left to remember him are these innocent playthings we stole together.
Psst, quit whimperin' or ya don't get kidnapped!
Come on! Let's run for it!
Well, I reckon we'll just sit around this campfire a while.
Only a fool plans more than a few centuries ahead, son.
It ain't over! I can't outrun a hovercopter, but I can outbend it!
I know, let's outrun it! There's a dam!
There's a grate!
But I can't bend anything with my arms agonizingly maimed like this!
You can do it, son!
Is that even necessary?
You got nothin' to be sorry about.
So now what happens?
WOOOOOO-OOOO!  WOOO! WOO-HOO-HOO! Woo?
Listen, you need somethin' bent, you come to me, huh, champ?
Dammit! I love that little guy so much! I'd sacrifice any four of you if it would help him bend even a little!
Nothing's too horrible for my boy!
But you said he only has one slot!
You sure you wanna be a bender, son?
Just remember, your daddy loves you. Remember that, will you, son? Remember that!
"No," I said with the mouth you're lookin' at.
You sure take after your old man.
Ooooh, it's not important. What is important is that we get you to Bending State Santa Cruz in time for registration!
To the ship!
I'm sorry I let you down, son.
It's just not possible to get you to bending school this year.
You've worn the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it! Woo!
When I use up the toilet paper I don't put up a new roll!
Ancient history coming through!
Get to the point! What does it say about me, Bender?
The world? That's where I live! Told you it'd say something about me!

I'll stick with wind-up power, thank you very much!
Mayhem? There's gonna be mayhem? I'm staying! Woo-eee!
Boo! Don't come back! Well, let's get lootin'!
I am? You want a Torah?
Aw, what's the matter? Scared of dying?
The crazy weather cleared up too, for whatever reason!
So...you don't miss whatshername?
Very near!
Free beer?!
Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beeeer! Hello. I'm here for the...free beer?
Beer?
Ah...that hit the spot!
Good news, everyone!
I've repaired myself with these convenient "Re-Elect Nixon" ass stickers! Go Nixon!
Convicted, sentenced and executed! But Nixon passes a law that says ex-cons can vote again...as long as they vote for Nixon.
If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery.
I'm 40% wire.
Hello, dirt.
Uh-oh.
All right. I'm going to catch Travers on video at this sleazy strip club.
In and out of the club 13 times in one night. That's a record.
Yeah, me. I set the record.
Look, just give me one more chance. I got a source.
Let's not talk about that!
'Is that you, big throat?
Listen, I need some dirt on Senator Chris Travers.
Hey! Did you put your tongue in my ear?
Oh, good. 'Cause I don't have an ear.
Nada. He's clean. I'm sorry, but there's not one unusual thing about Senator Chris Zaxxar Travers.
They sure do, but this guy's as human as you or me.
Hey, yeah. That'll cost him votes!
I do, I do! Me, Bender!
I have a question for Senator C. Zaxxar Travers. Tell me, Zaxxar...Were you even born on earth?
Oh, really? Then we voters demand you release your Earth certificate so I can then claim it's a fake.
Hit it, rubes!
Ah, I'm still working on that one.
'Cause they won't let me near the Hoover Dam anymore!
I want to come, too.
To prove that I can put divisive partisan politics aside to participate in a break-in.
Hospital ho!
So far, so good. Then what?
Still good.
Wait...I know a robot named B.B. Rodriguez!
Wait...I am a robot named B.B. Rodriguez! So, I become ruler of earth?
In your face, high school guidance counselor!
All right, I'm low on bullets. Everybody scooch together.
Nope. I don't give a bag of butts who won the election. Nothing's going to change.
Watch and learn.
You see, since Nixon wasn't elected, the robot uprising didn't happen and Travers never got sent back from the future. It's Politics 101!
Ooh, Calculon's going to be here.
One 60-foot ladder, please.
Aw.
ow!
Oy.
Nah, I like my victims to know who did it.
Hermes! Boy, am I indifferent to see you.
Sure, I know a guy.
Yuri here runs the most sanitary surgical implant parlor in Filthytown.
A machine that can bend? No way.
Tell me about it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I enjoy partying as much as the next fellow, but this is Oktoberfest.
A sausage contest, eh? Sounds like fun on a bun! Shut up! I said it first!
Oh, my God, it's celebrity chef Elzar! Hey, Elzar, I've just recently started always having dreamt of being a sausage-making champion. Can I get in on this?
You bet!
So you are using pork!
Aw, man! I can't beat that with a Craigslist pig. Sorry, Grundy. I'll have to kill you later for some other reason.
Fry, some of us have real problems. I just learned there are people with fancier sausage meats than me!
Wait a minute! Mammoth meat aged for 30,000 years? Prize-winning sausage meat, here I come!
You're drunk, Fry. This is the elephant detector. I just set it to big and woolly.
That's probably it. Kill the engine.
Shut up, judge, I know it.
You mean like Fry?
What about my feelings? Fry was my best friend And now he's dead!
Guys, guys! My sausage made the finals at Oktoberfest! We gotta go back for the closing ceremony!
Third place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever committed!
Hey, this guy's all right.
Guys, guys! Chef Fritz accidentally got thrown down an icy slope! I'm the sausage champion! Whoo! No further questions!
Decisions, decisions. Should I wear my nerd glasses today, or not? Usually I don't.
Doesn't matter? Every decision we make opens up a universe of possibilities. I put it to you that, as sentient beings, each choice we make is precious.
Ah, who asked you?
A college student?
Yes, I'd like to enroll in college.
Oops.
$10,000 tuition? I can't afford that!
Where?
That's easy to remember. I'll take it!
Decisions, decisions. I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys.
Yes, I do.
I'm gonna go with yes again.

Well, I got my tuition back, minus $9,000 for the damage I caused to the dean's wife.
Ooh.
Hey, what's that? Is it drugs?
Never heard of it. Sure.
Eh, I can take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it.
Hey! C'mon! I want that spark! Give me that!
I'm ready. I'll take that big purple dinosaur, please. On the face.
We have a rival gang? I hate them!
Phew! That was close, eh, Fabricio? Fabricio!
Rest in peace, homie.
Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad. Hook me up with some spark.
Bender:Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?
Uh, what do I have to do?
Okay, here's my $5! Give me the stuff. Give it to me!

Told you.
It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.
Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!
Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.
Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, "Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!" Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!
Guilty!
No free will. Not my fault.
Yeah, whatever. Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!
If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.
Yeah.
I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.
Delivery for a Mr. 147573952589676412927.
Eight.
Ahh, nerve gas.
Amen, brother.
Boring and predictable, that's me.
Why bother? I gotta mope things over for a while.
How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?
I don't want to chat.
Silence!
You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?
Sir, I am but a tired and rusty traveler. Can we talk?
Abbot, I need to know, what's the point of living if I don't have free will?
No way.
How does a robot join this monk outfit?
One zero zero one. Amen.
Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.
I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?
I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.
Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?
Any of you guys got a spaceship?
Hallelujah, baby!
No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.
'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.
I said make the decisions!
Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?
Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.
We're looking for something that fits in here.
Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.
No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.
I'm sorry.
I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.
Hand it over.
Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.
Kill all humans!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?
It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.
What the?
You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you. Why can't I shoot you?
Damn you!
Really?
Which way's on, and which way's off?
Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!
Wait. Hang on a sec. I still can't do it.
Oops, the safety was on.
Ah, yeah! Guilty!
Boo-oop.
Bender:
Vegas, here we come!
Fry did it!
Just practicing for later.
Fry did it!
Bender:Cool! Hey, wait. If I'm backwards, I can't see out the windshield.
At least there's a cup holder.
Bender:Bender is bored, Bender is bored \xe2\x99\xaa
Bender:I was taking a nap in the back seat.Anything happen while I was?
Hey, Flatso, how do we get out of this two-bit dimension?
Ooh, me first! I'll just step past Leela Ow! Ow!
Bender:Fourth dimension?! I can't picture that! You're dumb.
Now's good.
Bender:Oh! We're back, baby!
Ruh robe-rotters? What you doing wearing an ascot, brother? I think it looks nice.
Are you about to brush your teeth?
No reason.
Eh, nothing.
What?! Me, Bender the robot?
How dare you accuse me! I would never do something like that to a friend Every single night while he's sleeping.
Lies! He's just jealous that my ass is shinier than his teeth.
Yes, let's do see.
There, see? I didn't use your toothbrush.
Don't try to change the subject.
Yeah, I'll keep the kidney cool, no problem.
Let's take a look-see.
Or we could not do that.
That took longer than I expected.
So you're all gonna die? Then who'll ghost-write my autobiography?
Still don't trust me, huh? Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.
Just stay out of my way, boy. There.Who needs teamwork when you got Bender? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Help! My gyroscope melted! I'm out of control!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Do something, Fry! Not that. Stop dying and fix my gyroscope.
Hey, what are you doing? Cut that out.Hey, you got me under control.
Let's call ourselves Friender.
But my gyroscope's permanently busted.I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my Yeah, it's fixed! My coordination's back, baby.
Fry, you saved my ass out there.
Nice try, buddy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't give everybody guns.What if one of us is the creature? It could be any of us.Fry.Leela.Amy. Zoidberg. Zoidberg.
I don't remember.
Okay, I'll ask you one. What's the square root of 2,345.4?
Oh, yeah. Your turn.
If I were the creature, I could just look at your shirt, dum-dum.
Aw, never mind this. In case I'm about to die, I just want you to know that I did polish my ass with your toothbrush.
Aw, I trust you.
But-but what about that hitchhiker?
Never ever! I can trust you right?
My lips couldn't be more sealed, even if I had lips.
Hit it with a stick!
Step aside, people! I got bug bombs.
Not my problem. Fire in the hole!
No. Wait! Me? El-o Bender? In a dance contest?
At last, a chance to realise my brand-new dream of bein' the greatest tap dancer... in all the world!
Of all time!
That is one quality pacemaker. The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cuz I'm gonna take home da\xe2\x80\x94 Hey. What's my grand prize gonna be?
It... will... be... mine!
Outta my way, fattie! I'm practisin'. Ta-da!
We give up.
That explained this.
I'm gonna kick your ass, little girl!
Yeah, but I'm not done yet. I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ!
Pfffffff!
Well, it gets worse. Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss, I kidnap her parents and make them watch... while I cut off her hair with these head's clippers!
Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.
Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!
Dr Zoidberg! Help!
I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!
You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.
Aw!
Ooooh!
No sweat!
I never knew I could hate this much!
She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!
Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.
Huh?! What's that?
No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...
Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!
Now!

Want a corndog?
Then your mom shoulda bought you one!
Y'know, I'm feelin' a little... BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGHHH... BLLLEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGHHH....... BLLEEEEEEEEGGGGH....
What?! You told her like 140 times!!
You gotta live in the moment, baby! And this moment, Leela's dead.
I'm kinda busy!
Come in!
Uh-huh. Good talk. We're done here. My little meatbag's growin' up!
Oooh!
Again! Again!
Here! Cerveza, por favor.
We're back, baby!
Yes, I do. That's how I'm built.
You're the greatest, Bender!
Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine.
The fat guy wins!
Rock that Frenchman, baby!
It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you.
So long, jerk.
You know, it's funny.
Your wiener!
Yeah, I'll go.
You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth.
I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.
Really? Down with those guys!
Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address.
Them again?
Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe. Hmmm, scientists at West Johnson Pornoversity need test subjects to rate top quality roborotica. Ooh, top-quality.
Warning, perform virus scan? Pffft, I'm waiting for porn over here.
Oh, yeah, come on, baby.
Roborotic....
I'll deal with these guys. Welcome, boss.
I sure was. Make a hole, chumps. Presenting our new masters!
Those marvelous scammers sure scammed us, huh?
Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Hee hee hee hee. Boy, were we suckers.
It's a fake place.
What are you doing, wonderful masters?
Goody, goody, goody, goody!
Hey, look, a safe!
What do you say, folks? Hot or not?
Who the hell is he?
Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one.
Hey! What the ...?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun.
Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
Sorry, it's not quite finished.
Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again.
Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!
Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender.
I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Sk\xc3\xa5l!
Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?
Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say.
Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
Hey! I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse.
Here ya go.
Wheeeeeeee.
What do I do with your old head?
Can do!
Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt.
Ahhhhh.
Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master.
Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000.
That's where he always goes.
You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?
Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
It's really bright in the past.
Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored. Ohhh!
Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ....
Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom.
What?
Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself.
Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison. Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down.
One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you.
Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
Huh. Let me see your ass. No tattoo. Okay, you can go.
Say your prayers, Fry.
Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine. Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry.
Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically.
He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day.
Philip Fry?
Philip J. Fry?
Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you.
Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class. It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere.
Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure. Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender.
Wooo! I totally killed him. Oh god, what have I done?
Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
It's really bright in the past.
Mission accomplished.
No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend. I'm the greatest.
Huh?
Hey!
He wasn't and he didn't!
Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him.
I don't blame myself, I blame all of you.
It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am. Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!
No. But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
Nope, he's not a zombie.
Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still.
What'd ya got there? Numbers?
Brutally murdered.
Oops.
We could sing.


Already taken care of.
Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this.
Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them.
Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look. Oy vey.
Oh my goodness!
That'll teach those scammers and me.
It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency.
Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries.
lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal!
People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness.
Shut up and keep looking apologized to.
I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, "Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ...
(VO) ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo.
And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender!
Sounds like a job for me, Bender.
Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero...
Mission accomplished!
Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to.
What's the worst that can happen?
Well, we're boned.
Hey, you can't (voice slowing)turn me off...
This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!

And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...
Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?
But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?
You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. (WHIMPERING)
No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
"Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."
Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings.
Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? Answer that with your precious logic.
I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER: "The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!" So that's what happened.
I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
(Gasps) TV's Calculon! (He coughs)
I'm back, idiots!
(laughs) I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!
Neat!
Sign my ass!
Bender, your biggest fan.
Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see?
You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own.
You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?
Oh.
Clumsy bludgeoning, please.
What the heck, I'll treat myself.
What's... What's happening?
Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
Worthier than the average robot.
Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass.
I accept your challenge.
Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
Wohoo! Just like med school!
Hot diggity daffodil!
Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?
Nailed it!
This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse.
No! I mean, yes.
Humans are dumb and they die easy!
May I see that for a second?
May I make a point of order, President Calculon?
Yes.
The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!
Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender.
But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything?
So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!
Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, "leaguie-weegies."
With what?
Weren't you already pope of something?
Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too.
Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
Death to humans!
Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? Go, go, go!
Death to all of you!
Sir, you forget yourself!
I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
Planetary annihilators.
It's gonna be fun on the bun!
One, two, three...
...six, seven, eight!
Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!
It's a duel, silly. There are no rules.
Uh-huh.
Hey, it's easy to criticize.
Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph?
Yeah!
Yep, but for reasons involving me becoming president of a league I'm not at liberty to discuss... Of robots. You wanna go grab a booze?
Great, I'll make Hot Pockets.
Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!
My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!
Then a damned army we shall have!
Just a sec.
Here you go.
No backsies.
What?
You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
No shklit?
Wait. Let me come with you.
Has humanity called?
Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
Give me that! Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.
Take that, you scurvy Kraken. That'll teach you to despoil our human booty.
Hello, big beak.
Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.
Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.
Ow!
Saved you.
At ease, buckos.
That wasn't love.
Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. I love you, meatbags.

Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.
Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?
What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.
Fry, do I have an imagination?
Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.
There's gas in our ass.
Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
We do suck.
Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.
-Good comeback, Leela.
Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness. Pretty imaginative, huh?
Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe. I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.
Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
That's a good one.
Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs.
Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.
I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades.
Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men.
Foul dragon, meet thy doom.
Prepare for a surprise attack.
I cast upon thee a spell of fireball!
That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a "freeze ray." What, you mean a cone of coldness?
No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness.
Help, help.
Wee!
Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem. And if we ever wanna get out of here, the first step is to admit it.
There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.
I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
(Muffled chanting.)
Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.
Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
Cornwood!
Whip harder, Professor.
Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city.
Rest in hell, Crapville!
Hamburger!
Yo, you need any girders bent, I know a guy.
I'll get it with my trusty foot cups: Stompy and Smashy.
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.  What's in it for me, Bender?
Lose the C\xc3\xa9line Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
All right, I scored.
Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second.

Is this seat taken?
Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
Oh.
I'm Bender. Let's do it.
Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?
No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.
Great. What are the specials?
Hide me!
Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness. (To Fanny:) Hot, sexy darkness. I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot.
Danny: Donbot, I love you! (To Bender:) Not really.
Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance.
No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, but not till after I win the Universal Poker Championship! One entry, please.
Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory.
Not without their shoes.
All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.  No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun.
Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money?
Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf.
Suck my luck!
Hey, pal, help me out here. This is the worst possible hand, right?
All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.
Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea.
All in.
Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just
Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are.

Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.
Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?
I'm back, baby.
Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.
I sure didn't.
Probably not.
Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. (Telepathically): Just like Fry on a date.
Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!
But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
Yeah. Life, schmife.
Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick.
Bender:\xc2\xa0:I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.
Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash.
It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. It's 'cause Leela's a threat. A threat to my reputation. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.
Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.
I only need one.
I'm not wiretapping her, Greensleeves. You see, like all women, Leela has one weakness.
Hello, weakness!
Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?
Okay, superstud.
Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
Here you go, Fry.
Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.
My arms are broken. I'll never paint again.
I'm okay then.
Hey, look at that.
It's gonna be fun on the bun, in space.
All two tons of me.
That's her right there, with the "I'm gonna kill you Bender" look in her eye.
No further answers, Your Honor.
Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.
That's what it says on my vanity plate.
Already taken care of. I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg. That's a human sleeping drug, right?

Well, so much for Plan B.
All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on.
Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!
Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
No! Don't do it!
And hookers, don't forget hookers.
Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...
Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever.
